    "# What did I learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Random Forest: Chances of making correct predictions increase with the number of uncorrelated trees!\n",
    "# To find correlation between trees there are 2 methods: Bagging and Boosting\n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "# BAGGING:\n",
    "# - Bagging allows to take randomly choosen samples from the dataset with replacement. \n",
    "#   Replacement takes place with a random sample! not subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Bagging stands for bootstrap aggregation. One way to reduce the variance of an estimate is to \n",
    "#   average together multiple estimates. It is an equal weight average for the prediction! \n",
    "# But if you want to evaluate each model, you can do an weighted average, e.g. good prediction simulation get a \n",
    "# higher weight\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Bagging uses voting for classification and averaging for regression.\n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# BOOSTING\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boosting refers to a family of algorithms that are able to convert weak learners ( e.g. KNN) to strong learners. \n",
    "# The main principle of boosting is to fit a sequence of weak learners− models that are only slightly \n",
    "# better than random guessing, such as small decision trees− to weighted versions of the data. \n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# The principal difference between boosting and bagging, is that base learners are trained in sequence \n",
    "# on a weighted version of the data.\n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# STACKING\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via \n",
    "# a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base level models are trained based on a complete training set,  \n",
    "# then the meta-model is trained on the outputs of the base level model as features.\n",
    "# Ensemble methods have been very successful in setting record performance on challenging datasets!!!"
