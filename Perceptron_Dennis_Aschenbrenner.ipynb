    "# What is that??\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perceptor is similar to human neuron. It can be used in supervised and unsupervised learning. It gets \n",
    "# information from other neurons due to dendrids. The node is like a cell kernel (nucleus) where the information \n",
    "# get weights and pass to next layer, the hidden layer (perceptron has only 1 hidden layer). In the hidden layer \n",
    "# the weighted information will be added as sum and go forward to the activation function. Then the output will\n",
    "# be compared with the actual information. If there is a difference than it comes to back propagation with updating\n",
    "# weights. By updating weights the function tries to minimize the loss with a given learning rate and substraction\n",
    "# between actual and predicted value. If the learning rate is to large, you might miss the global minimum of the \n",
    "# loss function. If the learning rate is to small, the function might end at a local minima, without finding the \n",

    "# What is the activation function?\n",
